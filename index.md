## Why I took this class?

I took CSP because I was heavily influced by my father to get into computer science. My father always thought that this was the future which I completly agree with. I feel like with computer science you can create anything. With computer science I feel like I could design any video game I want because I play a lot of video games. I was also inspired by Bill Gates because when I was a kid I always looked up to those big guys such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerburg.

## Trouble Shooting

I faced many problems and struggled everyday. First my python wasn't downloading and it was sending my computer into a loop of downloading python and redownloading but then it was fixed when I down loaded python individually with the individual line. I went back to using the line that down loads everything and it successfully downloaded ruby but python would only show up if I did python3. Then it sent my PIP into a loop of downloading and I figured that out because I tried downloading the gems along with the Jupyter and it finally showed up but my Jupyter would say that it was downloaded but it wasn't able to locate it. After solving all my problems with the loop holes and not being able to locate files and what not I was finally able to code.

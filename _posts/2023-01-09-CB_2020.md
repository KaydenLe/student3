# My Score
63/67
# My Journey
In CSP I didn't know anything at first but I had an idea how to code. Last trimester I learned a lot how to create a blog and how to create my passion project. Now I learned how to code a binary game.
# My Discovery
**Questions I got Wrong.**
Q27: I got this wrong because I didn't understand what it was asking. The correct answer didn't make sense to me because of the word "exist".
Q15: I got this wrong because I didn't see what was the difference in the two programs but I didn't notice that the two values were the same and in the same order so I thought the values were different.
Q14: I just thought that this question for me was a little difficult to understand and also the passage was a little too long. I looked at the steps but I thought it would display a remainder instad of a integer.
Q13: I got this wrong because I thought it was asking th total number of books that was due to be returned because of the second to last bullet point and I didn't know it was asking about books never borrowed in a given year.
**Review**
I should review the listens and the topics that I got wrong because last time I got 66/66 and I know I can do better and I know I can get a bettter score if I review the lessons on the questions I got wrong.

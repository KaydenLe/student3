Quiz was not loading up on to the blog and it still has not beed resolved but it is playable on VSCode.
My theory for why the quiz is not working is because my theme was preventing the for the quiz to work. Tried changing the the theme but the new theme didn't load up on to the blog.
Started a new reposoritory and trasnfered all my work but it was having trouble creating a make. The make had many errors such as having an air for a markdown that didn't exist. I resolved this problem by going to week 1 hacks and putting in the make line in order to have the make to work. I don't have theme because I don't won't to deal with the problems with one until my quiz works.
This whole week I basically had to start a new repository from scratch and added the quiz and copy and pasted the home from the old repository.
